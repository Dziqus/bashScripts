# bashScripts

Theses are mostly my scripts I use for different stuff like setting up enviroments, troubleshooting, fun etc. You're welcome to using them.


### debianNetworkInfo

This is just a debian bash script that lets you easily troubleshoot your network. It gathers different information like ifconfig, route, interfaces, pinging gateway etc.

#### Use
Just run the script. It's that easy. The results should be in folder in your user home directory but the script will iinform you where it exactly is.
